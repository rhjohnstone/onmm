## $O(n)$ Matrix Multiplication Lightning App

Make sure `lightning` is installed:
```shell
pip install lightning
```

Clone this repo and install all the requirements:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app locally:
```shell
lightning run app app.py --name onmm
```

Run the app on the cloud (this requires you to have an account with credits, but I think you get some for free when you sign up):
```shell
lightning run app app.py --name onmm --cloud
```
